1.Learn a decision tree and save the tree
Enter the file path where you want to save the file, no need to put the file name. Program will generate text file at given location named as (DecisionTree.txt)   
2.Testing accuracy of the decision tree
In this option user will get confusion Metrix
3. Applying the decision tree to new cases
Answer the question, make sure the answer must match from training file
4.Load a tree model and apply to new cases interactively as in menu
Enter the File path with file name that was created in 1 option.
5.Quit
